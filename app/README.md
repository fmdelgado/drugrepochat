The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for this project are:

1. `ChatBot`: This class will handle the interaction with the OpenAI GPT-3 model. It will have the following methods:
    - `__init__`: This method will initialize the chatbot with the necessary API key.
    - `generate_response`: This method will take user input and generate a response using the GPT-3 model.

2. `app`: This function will be the entry point of the Streamlit application. It will handle the user interface and interaction with the `ChatBot` class.

Now, let's write the code for each file.
